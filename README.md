# Normsim

# This repository contains four relevant files: "Normsim.Rproj", "simulation.R", and "separate_plots.R", and "combined_plots.R". 
# "Normsim.Rproj" exists because this was created as an Rproject.
# The Rscript called "simulation.R" contains code to produce an agent-based simulation. This script has to be executed first. The order of the plot-producing scripts below doesn't matter.
# The script called "separate_plots.R" produces separate plots for each parameter combination. It creates a subdirectory for each parameter combination and stores the plots in those subdirectories.
# The script called "combined_plots.R" produces combined plots, which show the dynamics of Alt choices, miscoordination, average payoffs, and gini coefficients. Those four measures are shown as four subplots in the combined plots. Each combined plot compares amenable and resistant targets, for given parameter combinations.
