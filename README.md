# Normsim

## This is an Rproject associated with the paper "When norm change hurts" by  Charles Efferson, Sönke Ehret, Lukas von Flüe, and Sonja Vogt.

#### This Rproject contains three relevant files: "Normsim.Rproj", "simulation.R", and "plots.R".
#### "Normsim.Rproj" exists because this was created as an Rproject. When opening this as an Rproject, working directories do not have to be created manually.
#### The Rscript called "simulation.R" contains code to produce the simulation. This script has to be executed first.
#### The script called "plots.R" produces all plots and retrieves the largest difference in Gini coefficient between amenable and resistant targets for given parameter combinations of alpha, phi, a, and h.
