# Normsim

# This repository contains three relevant files: "Normsim.Rproj", "simulation.R", and "analysis.R". 
# "Normsim.Rproj" exists because this was created as an Rproject.
# The Rscript called "simulation.R" contains code to produce an agent-based simulation. 
# The second script is called "analysis.R", which loads and analyses output from "simulation.R".
